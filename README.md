# 🏦 Bank Reconciliation Automation (n8n + AI)

An end-to-end **finance automation workflow** built with **n8n**, **Google Sheets**, **Gmail**, and **Google Gemini AI** — designed to automatically reconcile bank statements with accounting records, flag discrepancies, and generate AI-powered summary reports.

## 📌 Overview

Manual bank reconciliation is time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates the entire process — from reading transaction data to generating a professional summary report — with zero manual intervention.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 **Dynamic comparison** — works with any invoice/reference number, no hardcoded values
- ✅ Automatically detects:
  - Matched Transactions
  - Amount Mismatches
  - Missing in Books
  - Missing in Bank
- 📊 Saves matched records into a Google Sheets reconciliation report
- 📧 Sends instant Gmail alerts for unmatched transactions
- 🤖 Generates an AI-powered summary (via Google Gemini) with insights & recommendations
- 📄 Automatically saves the summary report into Google Docs

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **n8n** | Workflow automation engine |
| **Google Sheets** | Data source (Bank Statement & Accounting Records) |
| **JavaScript (Code Node)** | Dynamic reconciliation logic |

## 📈 Sample Output

| Reference | Bank Amount | Accounting Amount | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| INV001 | 1000 | 1000 | ✅ Matched |
| INV002 | 2500 | 2500 | ✅ Matched |
| INV003 | 1500 | – | ❌ Missing in Books |
| INV004 | – | 1800 | ❌ Missing in Bank |

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Trigger reads transactions from both Bank Statement and Accounting Records sheets.
2. A Code node dynamically compares transactions by `Reference` and `Amount`.
3. Results are routed through an IF node:
   - **Matched** → saved to Google Sheets report
   - **Unmatched** → Gmail alert sent
4. Simultaneously, all results are sent to Gemini AI to generate a professional summary.
5. The summary is inserted into a Google Docs report, timestamped by date.
